# DJLyrithm: Creative Hub

This is the personal site and creative hub for **DJLyrithm** — a poet, music creator, and beautifully chaotic human. Built with ❤️ by a friend, for a friend.

> “Sometimes I’m writing. Sometimes I’m streaming a game. Sometimes I’m doing absolutely nothing 😏 (judgment-free zone, remems?)”

## 🎵 What’s Here?

- 🎧 **Music** – Links to tracks and experiments made with tools like [Suno](https://suno.com/@djlyrithm)
- ✍️ **Poetry** – A place to read, reflect, and maybe get inspired
- 🌐 **Social** – Follow the chaos (or peace) wherever it flows
- 🧪 **Built With** – SvelteKit + Tailwind + TypeScript
