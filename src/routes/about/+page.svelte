			DJ Lyrithm is more than just a name — it's a mark. It carries my voice, my scars, and the
			things I never thought I'd say out loud. It&apos;s how I process pain, find the beauty in it,
			and turn it into something I can share.

			feel too much, speak too little, or have been told they don't belong. For anyone still learning
			to live with their past without being defined by it. If that&apos;s you — you're not alone.
